## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the complete technical requirements for converting sodakedutech.in from a static HTML wireframe into a production-grade, CMS-driven multi-page web platform. It translates the business objectives in the BRD into software deliverables a developer can implement directly.

### 1.2 Scope

The system comprises:
- A public-facing marketing website (35 pages)
- A role-gated admin panel (7+ sections)
- A REST API backend
- A relational database
- A media processing pipeline
- An email notification system
- A lead management inbox

The system does **not** include: student login, course delivery, video hosting, online payments, or Tamil localisation (all deferred to later phases per the BRD).

### 1.3 Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **BRD** | Business Requirements Document (`01-SoDak-EduTech-BRD.md`) |
| **SRS** | This document |
| **TPO** | Training & Placement Officer — primary external persona |
| **Wireframe** | Static HTML/CSS prototype in `C:/Users/DELL/Docs/wireframe/` |
| **Module** | A self-contained unit of functionality with a defined boundary and no hidden dependencies on other modules |
| **Low coupling** | Design principle: modules interact only through narrow, explicit interfaces; changing one module's internals does not break others |
| **ISR** | Incremental Static Regeneration — pages rebuilt in the background when data changes, cached copy served until then |
| **CMS** | Content Management System — the admin panel in this project |
| **slug** | URL-safe identifier, e.g. `amazon-trainer-arjun` |

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

SoDak EduTech's website is the primary lead-generation channel for campus placement training. The current state is a static HTML wireframe. The target state is a dynamic platform where:
- Content editors publish trainers, programs, and photos without code changes.
- TPOs and faculty arrive via search or WhatsApp referral, evaluate SoDak's credibility, and submit an enquiry.
- The sales team works that enquiry through a pipeline to a signed program contract.

The website links outward to three separate SoDak products (CTF, LMS, Assessment Engine) but does not embed them.

### 2.2 Product Functions (summary)

| Domain | Public-facing | Admin-facing |
|---|---|---|
| Trainers | Directory, filters, individual profiles | CRUD, photo upload, consent flag |
| Mentors | Directory, 1-on-1 booking interest, FAQ | CRUD, availability toggle |
| Programs | Listing, track filters, detail + syllabus | CRUD, PDF brochure upload |
| Courses | Domain-based catalogue | CRUD, stack tagging |
| Training stacks | 6 stack pages with technology lists | CRUD, icon/colour tokens |
| Institutions | Partner directory, per-college case page | CRUD, logo upload, permission flag |
| Gallery | Photo grid, lightbox, institution/year filters | Upload (bulk), tag, alt text gate |
| Webinars | Listing, registration interest form | CRUD, schedule |
| Internships | Listing with company + role cards, apply form | CRUD |
| Blog/Insights | Listing, post detail | Draft→Review→Publish workflow |
| Careers | Job listing, role detail, application form | CRUD, open/close flag |
| Platform | CTF / LMS / Assessment overview pages | Static (edited in code; low-churn) |
| Leads | — | Inbox, pipeline status, CSV export |
| Media Library | — | Upload, search, alt-text edit, reuse |
| Analytics | — | Page views, lead sources, click-throughs |
| Settings | — | Site metadata, social links, stat counters |

### 2.3 User Roles

Refer to BRD §4 for the full role table. From a software access-control perspective:

| Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| `super_admin` | All CRUD, user management, settings, audit log, delete |
| `editor` | Create/edit/publish content and media; no user management |
| `contributor` | Edit own trainer/mentor profile; submit blog drafts; no publish |
| `sales` | Read/update leads and pipeline status; no content access |
| `visitor` | Read published pages; submit forms |

### 2.4 Constraints

- **Cost:** ₹0 recurring beyond domain. Infrastructure must use free tiers (Vercel/Netlify + PlanetScale/Neon/Supabase or Railway free tier).
- **No vendor lock-in for content:** structured data in a relational DB, not a proprietary headless CMS.
- **Static-first delivery:** pages rendered at build or ISR; DB is never in the critical path for a public request.
- **Consent gates:** a trainer/institution record cannot be published without consent flags set.

### 2.5 Assumptions

- Next.js 14+ (App Router) is the selected framework; its built-in ISR satisfies the static-first constraint.
- Prisma ORM over PostgreSQL.
- Email via Resend (free tier: 3,000 emails/month).
- Image optimisation via Next.js `<Image>` + Cloudflare R2 (free tier) for storage.
- All wireframe pages in `C:/Users/DELL/Docs/wireframe/` are the approved visual reference; any deviation must be approved.

### 3.2 Low Coupling Design Principles

Low coupling is the primary architectural constraint on the software layer. The following rules are mandatory:

#### 3.2.1 Module Isolation Rule

Every domain (trainers, programs, institutions, gallery, blog, leads, careers, internships, webinars, platform) is implemented as an isolated module with:

```
src/
  modules/
    trainers/
      trainers.service.ts      ← all DB logic for this domain
      trainers.schema.ts       ← Zod validation schemas
      trainers.types.ts        ← TypeScript interfaces
    programs/
      programs.service.ts
      programs.schema.ts
      programs.types.ts
    institutions/
      ...
    gallery/
      ...
    leads/
      ...
    ...
```

**Rule:** A service file may only import from:
1. Its own module's `types.ts` and `schema.ts`
2. `src/lib/db.ts` (Prisma client singleton)
3. `src/lib/storage.ts` (R2 client singleton)
4. `src/lib/email.ts` (Resend client singleton)
5. Node/npm utilities

A service file **must not** import from another module's service. Cross-module reads use the other module's exported types only (never the service function itself — the API route composes them).

#### 3.2.2 API as Composition Layer

API route handlers (`/api/trainers/route.ts`, etc.) are the only place that composes across modules. Example: a trainer profile page may need trainer data + institutions they've trained at + blog posts they authored. The API route calls `trainers.service.getById()`, `institutions.service.getByTrainerId()`, and `blog.service.getByAuthor()` — three separate calls, assembled in the route handler.

```
// CORRECT
// api/trainers/[id]/route.ts
const trainer   = await trainersService.getById(id);
const colleges  = await institutionsService.getByTrainerId(id);
const posts     = await blogService.getByAuthor(id);
return { trainer, colleges, posts };

// WRONG — cross-module import inside a service
// trainers.service.ts
import { blogService } from '../blog/blog.service';   // ← forbidden
```

#### 3.2.3 Shared Kernel (lib/)

Infrastructure code that is genuinely shared lives in `src/lib/` and has no domain logic:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `db.ts` | Prisma client singleton |
| `storage.ts` | R2 upload/URL helper |
| `email.ts` | Resend send helper |
| `auth.ts` | Session/JWT validation helper |
| `slugify.ts` | Slug generation utility |
| `paginate.ts` | Cursor/offset pagination helper |
| `image.ts` | Sharp-based resize pipeline |

#### 3.2.4 Frontend Module Boundary

Each Next.js page under `app/(public)/[domain]/` imports only:
1. Its own domain's API data via `fetch('/api/[domain]/...')`
2. Shared UI components from `src/components/ui/`
3. Layout components from `src/components/layout/`

Pages do not share state with each other. A trainer profile page does not "know" it is linked from the trainers directory — it only knows its own data.

#### 3.2.5 Event-Driven Side Effects

When an action in one module must trigger side effects in another (e.g., publishing a trainer sends a notification email), use a thin event emitter rather than a direct service call:

```
// trainers.service.ts
await db.trainer.update({ where: { id }, data: { published: true } });
emit('trainer.published', { trainerId: id });   // ← event, not a call

// notifications/handlers.ts  (subscribes to events, not imported by trainers)
on('trainer.published', async ({ trainerId }) => {
  await emailService.send({ template: 'trainer-live', ... });
});
```

This removes the dependency between `trainers.service` and `email.ts` entirely.

#### 3.2.6 Admin Panel Isolation

The admin panel is a separate Next.js route group `app/(admin)/`. It has its own layout, its own auth middleware, and its own API calls. It does not share React components with the public site except from the shared `src/components/ui/` kit.

### 3.3 Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14+ (App Router) | ISR, RSC, API routes, built-in image optimisation |
| Language | TypeScript (strict) | Type-safe module contracts enforce the coupling rules |
| ORM | Prisma 5 | Type-safe DB access, migration tooling |
| DB | PostgreSQL (Neon free tier) | Serverless-compatible, free |
| Auth | NextAuth.js v5 | Handles sessions, CSRF, role callbacks |
| Media storage | Cloudflare R2 | S3-compatible, free egress |
| Image processing | Sharp (server-side) | Resize/format conversion at upload time |
| Email | Resend | Generous free tier, simple API |
| Spam protection | Cloudflare Turnstile | Free, no CAPTCHA UX |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, purges unused CSS, consistent with wireframe tokens |
| Validation | Zod | Schema-first, works in API and form layers |
| Deployment | Vercel | Free hobby tier, edge caching, ISR support |

| AP-1.1 | Email + password login; Argon2id hashing (not bcrypt — Argon2 is OWASP-recommended as of 2024) |
| AP-1.2 | Session via NextAuth.js with database sessions (not JWTs); session invalidated after 8h idle |
| AP-1.3 | RBAC enforced at API middleware level; UI hiding alone is insufficient |
| AP-1.4 | `/admin` routes protected by Next.js middleware checking session + role before any page renders |
| AP-1.5 | "Forgot password" flow: time-limited token (15 min) sent by email, single-use |
| AP-1.6 | Super admin can create/deactivate accounts and assign roles; deactivated accounts cannot log in |

### 6.2 Content Workflows

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| AP-2.1 | Every content record has `status ∈ {draft, published}` (and `in_review` for blog); draft records are invisible to public pages |
| AP-2.2 | Editors can preview draft content at `/admin/preview/[type]/[id]` — a server component that bypasses the published gate |
| AP-2.3 | Soft delete: records moved to `deleted_at` timestamp; hard-delete only after 30 days (cron job) |
| AP-2.4 | Consent gates: `consent_on_file` (trainers), `logo_permission` (institutions), `student_consent_ref` (gallery) — checked in service layer before `is_published` can be set |

### 6.3 Media Library

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| AP-3.1 | Centralised media library at `/admin/media`; all uploads go through it |
| AP-3.2 | Upload: JPG/PNG/WebP/GIF (images), PDF (documents); max 10 MB per file |
| AP-3.3 | Image processing pipeline (Sharp, server-side): `original`, `lg` (1200px), `md` (800px), `sm` (400px), `thumb` (200px); all converted to WebP; AVIF generated for lg and md |
| AP-3.4 | Alt text editable after upload; required before an image can be used on a published record |
| AP-3.5 | Reuse: media picker shows library thumbnails; selecting reuses the existing R2 object rather than re-uploading |
| AP-3.6 | Search by filename, alt text, upload date |

### 6.4 Audit Log

Every create/update/delete/publish/unpublish action writes an `audit_log` record:

```
audit_log {
  id, actor_id (→ users), action, entity_type, entity_id,
  old_value (JSONB), new_value (JSONB), created_at
}
```

Viewable by `super_admin` at `/admin/audit-log`. Retained for 1 year.

### 6.5 Dashboard

| Widget | Data source |
|---|---|
| Total leads (7d / 30d) | `leads` table |
| Lead status breakdown | Grouped count by `status` |
| Top pages by view | Analytics (Plausible / Umami self-hosted) |
| Recent enquiries | `leads` latest 5 |
| Unpublished trainers awaiting consent | `trainers WHERE consent_on_file = false` |
| Pending blog drafts | `blog_posts WHERE status = 'in_review'` |

## 7. External Interface Requirements

### 7.1 User Interface

The wireframe in `C:/Users/DELL/Docs/wireframe/` is the approved UI specification. Deviations require explicit approval. Key UI contracts:

- Navigation: sticky white nav, 64px height, 7 items, hamburger at ≤960px
- Cards: glassmorphism (`rgba(255,255,255,0.72)`, `blur(20px)`, `border: 1px solid rgba(7,88,146,0.18)`)
- Primary button: `#075892` background, white text, 8px border-radius
- Typography: Open Sans (body), Instrument Sans (headings) — both served as local `@font-face` (no CDN dependency)
- Dark sections: `linear-gradient(160deg, #0a1628, #0c2040)`
- Light sections: `#ffffff` background

### 7.2 API Interface

All API routes follow REST conventions under `/api/v1/`:

- `GET /api/v1/[resource]` — list with pagination and filters
- `GET /api/v1/[resource]/[id]` — single record
- `POST /api/v1/[resource]` — create (admin only)
- `PATCH /api/v1/[resource]/[id]` — partial update (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/v1/[resource]/[id]` — soft delete (admin only)
- `POST /api/v1/[resource]/[id]/publish` — publish action (editor+)
- `POST /api/v1/[resource]/[id]/unpublish` — unpublish (editor+)

Public `GET` endpoints require no auth. Write endpoints require a valid session and role check. See §10 for per-resource endpoints.

### 7.3 Third-Party Integrations

| Service | Integration point | Coupling |
|---|---|---|
| Cloudflare R2 | `src/lib/storage.ts` — single upload/get/delete wrapper | Isolated: swap to S3 by editing one file |
| Resend | `src/lib/email.ts` — `sendEmail(template, to, data)` wrapper | Isolated: swap to Nodemailer by editing one file |
| Cloudflare Turnstile | Client-side widget + `POST /api/v1/verify-turnstile` server validation | Form-specific; no cross-module dependency |
| Plausible Analytics | `<script>` in `_app` layout — no server coupling | Zero coupling |
| NextAuth.js | `src/lib/auth.ts` + `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` | Isolated in lib + single route |

| NFR-P3 | Hero image | ≤ 200 KB (WebP), served via CDN |
| NFR-P4 | All images below fold | Lazy-loaded (`loading="lazy"`) |
| NFR-P5 | First JS bundle | < 100 KB gzip |
| NFR-P6 | All public pages | Statically generated or ISR-cached |

| NFR-S7 | Rate limiting on form endpoints: 5 submissions / IP / hour via Upstash Redis (free tier) or Vercel Edge Config |
| NFR-S8 | Audit log on all admin writes (§6.4) |

### 8.3 Reliability & Availability

| NFR-A4 | Keyboard navigable: all interactive elements reachable by Tab; `focus-visible` styles present |
| NFR-A5 | FAQ collapsible uses `<button>` elements with `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes |
| NFR-A6 | Hamburger menu: `aria-label="Open menu"` / `"Close menu"` toggled in JS |

### 8.5 SEO

| ID | Requirement |

| NFR-SEO2 | Canonical URLs on all pages |
| NFR-SEO3 | Open Graph tags and OG image on all published records |
| NFR-SEO4 | JSON-LD structured data per FR-10.3 |
| NFR-SEO5 | `sitemap.xml` auto-generated; submitted to Google Search Console at launch |
| NFR-SEO6 | All old `/#anchor` routes redirect 301 to new clean URLs |

### 8.6 Privacy (DPDP Act 2023)

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| NFR-PR1 | Enquiry forms have explicit consent checkbox with stated purpose before submission is accepted |
| NFR-PR2 | Privacy Policy and Terms of Service live at `/privacy` and `/terms`; linked in footer (already in wireframe) |
| NFR-PR3 | Personal data (trainer photos, leads) deletable on request via soft-delete + hard-delete pipeline |
| NFR-PR4 | Lead data retention policy: hard-deleted after 2 years if status remains `lost` |

## 11. Deployment & Infrastructure

### 11.1 Environments

| Environment | Host | DB | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `local` | `localhost:3000` | Local PostgreSQL or Docker | Development |
| `preview` | Vercel preview URL | Neon dev branch | PR review |
| `production` | `sodakedutech.in` | Neon main branch | Live site |

### 11.2 CI/CD

- GitHub Actions: lint → type-check → test → build on every PR
- Vercel: auto-deploys on push to `main`; preview deployments on PRs
- Prisma migrations run as a deploy step (`prisma migrate deploy`)
- Env vars managed in Vercel dashboard; never in git

### 11.3 Free-Tier Stack

| Service | Free tier limit | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Vercel Hobby | 100 GB bandwidth/mo, 100 ISR calls/sec | Very low for this traffic level |
| Neon PostgreSQL | 512 MB storage, 1 compute unit | Low; content DB is small |
| Cloudflare R2 | 10 GB storage, 1M Class B ops/mo | Low for initial content volume |
| Resend | 3,000 emails/mo | Low; notification volume is minimal |
| Upstash Redis | 10,000 req/day | Low; rate-limiting only |

---

## 12. Acceptance Criteria

From BRD §10, expanded with software specifics:

| # | Criterion | Test method |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | Editor creates trainer with photo; live within 2 min, no deploy | Admin UI → publish; verify `/trainers/[slug]` updates within ISR window |
| AC-2 | Trainer with `consent_on_file = false` cannot be published | API PATCH `is_published: true` → expect 422 |
| AC-3 | Enquiry submitted from mobile arrives in admin inbox and notification email within 60s | End-to-end test with phone + email monitoring |
| AC-4 | Image published without alt text is rejected | API `POST /photos/:id/publish` with null alt → expect 422 |
| AC-5 | Mobile Lighthouse ≥ 90 on Home, Trainers, Programs | `lighthouse` CLI with mobile preset |
| AC-6 | All old anchor redirects return HTTP 301 | `curl -I /#trainers` → expect 301 to `/trainers` |
| AC-7 | Nightly backup runs 7 consecutive days | Check backup storage timestamps |
| AC-8 | Privacy policy and Terms linked in footer on every page | Automated link checker |
| AC-9 | RBAC: sales user cannot access trainer CRUD endpoints | API calls with sales session → expect 403 |
| AC-10 | Bulk photo upload of 20 images completes with progress feedback | Admin UI test; all 20 appear in library |
| AC-11 | FAQ cards on mentors page open/close on click (JS toggle) | Browser test: click `.faq-header`, verify `.faq-item.open` class added |
| AC-12 | Admin audit log records every publish action with actor and timestamp | Publish trainer; check `audit_log` table |
